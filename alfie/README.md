## Summary

Alfie is a demonstration robot running ROS2 on a Raspberry Pi. He is built using Lego and EV3 motors with the Dexter Industries BrickPi3+ providing the hardware interface from the Raspberry Pi to the EV3 motors.

He is based on a Lego Technic RS Q e-tron 42160 model. This is a Lego remote control car. The robot car just uses the base chassis. The Lego Technic RC motors have been replaced with Lego EV3 motors (they are of similar dimensions). The Lego Hub is replaced with Raspberry Pi/BrickPi3+
