In the above and below pictures, note the axle is not going through the centre frame 7x5 hole, but is through hole to the left. There is no centre hole in the 7x5 frame in this orientation. Later when positioned correctly on the base frame, the axle will be above stud #9 on the base frame, and therefore above the centre of the side of the base.

In step 6 below, this requires careful positioning to be symmetric. The axle should be above stud #9 in the base side.

We need beams of length 8. A length of 9 will not fit, and 7 is too short. There is no standard lego technic beam of length 8, so here is my version.

Our base is an equilateral triangle of length 17. From the top angle we can count down studs from 1-8 to form another smaller equilateral triangle whose base is of length 8. Hence the cross connection between the 5x7 frames of length 8. This adds strength to the structure.

By symmetry we do the same to the other angles.
